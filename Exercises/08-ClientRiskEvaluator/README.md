# Let's practice: Client Risk Evaluator

Build a `ClientRiskEvaluator` class that calculates the risk score for a client based on specific risk factors. Each factor contributes a certain number of points to the client's overall risk score. Additionally, ensure that the input data is validated.

## Risk Factors
1. **Age**: If the client is under 18, add 20 points to the risk score.
2. **Employment Status**: If the client is unemployed, add 10 points to the risk score.
3. **[Optional] Debt-to-Income Ratio**: If the client's debt-to-income ratio is above 40%, add 25 points to the risk score.
