# TDD Kata: Roman Numerals Kata

The objective of this exercise is to implement a method that takes a number and converts it to the according String Roman representation.

You will use Test-Driven Development (TDD) to guide your implementation, writing tests before writing the actual implementation code.

Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome. The basic Roman numerals and their corresponding integer values are:

1 ➔ I
2 ➔ II
3 ➔ III
4 ➔ IV
5 ➔ V
9 ➔ IX
10 ➔ X
21 ➔ XXI
50 ➔ L
100 ➔ C
500 ➔ D
900 ➔ CM
1000 ➔ M

Roman numerals are typically written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, some numbers use subtractive notation, where a smaller numeral before a larger numeral indicates subtraction (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).

## Requirements

1. **Integer to Roman Numerals**:
    - Convert integers in the range from 1 to 10000 to Roman numerals.
    - Use standard Roman numeral conventions (e.g., 4 is IV, 9 is IX).

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
    - Create a new project in your preferred language.
    - Set up a testing framework (e.g., xUnit).

2. **Write Tests**:
    - Start by writing tests for the simplest cases.
    - Gradually add more tests covering different scenarios, including edge cases.

3. **Implement the Functionality**:
    - Implement the code to make the tests pass.
    - Refactor your code to improve its structure and readability while keeping the tests green.
